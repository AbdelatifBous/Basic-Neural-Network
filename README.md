# Basic Neural Network
On the process of learning Deeplearning, i built Basic Neural Network to get full understanding without help of ML library.

## Overview
A neural network written in Python, consisting of a single neuron that uses back propagation to learn.
You can have quick review with [juputer notebook file](https://github.com/avvineed/Basic-Neural-Network/blob/master/basic-neural-network.ipynb).
## Dependencies

None! Just numpy.
